# Text_to_Speech_Recognition

Vision is an indispensable sense, shaping our understanding of the world around us. However, for individuals with visual impairments, navigating daily tasks can be challenging. Our project aims to enhance accessibility for the visually impaired by leveraging technology to assist in text recognition and language detection.

Our solution is divided into two key components. Firstly, we utilize the Tesseract OCR engine to extract text from images, enabling users to access printed materials effortlessly. Secondly, our algorithm incorporates language detection capabilities to ensure accurate interpretation of the text for the user.

The text recognition process begins with image processing, where the OCR algorithm identifies and extracts text from images or other visual content. Once the text is recognized, it undergoes language detection to determine whether it is in Bangla or English. Subsequently, language processing algorithms are employed to correct any errors and enhance readability if necessary. Finally, the extracted text is converted into audio using text-to-speech technology, providing users with a seamless auditory experience.

By bridging the gap between visual content and auditory accessibility, our project aims to empower individuals with visual impairments, enabling them to engage with printed materials independently and enhancing their overall quality of life.
